# Introduction to Bash

## What is Bash?

Bash (short for Bourne-Again SHell) is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox in 1989, as an alternative for the Bourne shell (sh),created by Stephen Bourne in 1979. 
It is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. 
Bash provides a command-line interface (CLI) where users can execute commands, run scripts, and automate tasks.

### Why Learn Bash?

- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks using Bash scripts.
- **Efficiency**: Execute complex tasks quickly with simple commands.
- **Versatility**: Work across different Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS.

### Basic Bash Workflow

1. **Commands**: Enter commands in the terminal to interact with the system.
2. **Scripts**: Combine multiple commands into a single file to automate tasks.
3. **Execution**: Run scripts or commands to perform specific operations.

### How to Access Bash

- **Linux**: Open the terminal.
- **macOS**: Use the Terminal app.
- **Windows**: Use the WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux (wsl --install) or Git Bash.

```bash
# Opening a Terminal
# On Linux or macOS, press Ctrl + Alt + T, or search for 'Terminal'.
```

### Your First Bash Command

Open your terminal and type the following command:

```bash
echo "Hello World!"
```

This command prints `Hello, World!` to the terminal. Congratulations, you've just executed your first Bash command!
